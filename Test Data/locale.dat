3425902017	ucdt	Victory Generators are Refineries that have been charged with a Victory Core. These Generators are important to defend, as they will slowly generate Victory Points which allow your faction to secure control of a continent. Enemy Victory Generators can be destroyed by attacking the shielded area near the center of the device, and destroying the floating core within. When the core is destroyed, the generator will detonate, so be sure to clear the area. Destroying enemy cores essentially steals the core from that faction; reducing the total number of active cores they can have up while at the same time increasing the total number of active cores your faction can have up.
