#PS2Edit: PS2 File Viewer and Editor

PS2Edit can be used to view and modify Planetside 2's assets, including:

* Viewing and editing of compressed pack file contents (models, images, sounds, graphics settings, scaleform UI files)
* Replacement of font files
* Replacement of entries in locale files
* Extraction of high resolution continent maps

PS2Edit's compressed asset patching only works on the PTS. It will not run on live servers.
