#PS2Edit: PS2 File Viewer and Editor

PS2Edit can be used to view Planetside 2's assets on the PTS. By right clicking an asset and selecting edit, that asset can be modified.

PS2Edit's patching only works on the PTS. It will not run on live servers.

If you circumvent this check and run on live servers, it will be detected and you will be banned. Can't say I didn't warn you. Don't be stupid please.
